# Tree Data Structure Project

## Overview
This project implements a tree data structure in C++. The program provides functionality to create, manage, and interact with a tree, including insertion, traversal, and other operations. The main logic is handled in the `main1.cpp` file, while the `tree.cpp` and `tree.h` files manage the tree structure and related operations.

## Features
- **Tree Data Structure**: Implements a tree data structure for organizing and storing data.
- **Insertion**: Supports insertion of nodes into the tree.
- **Traversal**: Allows for traversal of the tree using standard methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Modular Design**: The code is split into separate files (`tree.h` for declarations and `tree.cpp` for implementation) for easy maintenance and extension.

## Class Overview
- **`tree.h`**: Header file that contains the declarations for the tree class and its member functions.
- **`tree.cpp`**: Implementation file that contains the logic for the tree operations (e.g., insertion, traversal).
- **`main1.cpp`**: The entry point for the program, where the tree is instantiated and various operations are performed.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arnold-shakirov/tree-functions.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    

3. Compile the C++ files:
    ```bash
    g++ -o main main1.cpp tree.cpp
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

## Requirements
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler such as `g++` installed on your system.
- **C++17** or higher recommended.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the C++ files using `g++` or any other standard C++ compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ -o main main1.cpp tree.cpp
    ```

3. Run the program by executing:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```
