# Tree functions

## Overview
This C++ project contains a program implemented in the `main.cpp` file, designed for executing specific computational tasks efficiently. The program processes input, runs algorithms, and outputs results based on defined logic. The code is structured for flexibility, allowing easy modifications or extensions.

## Features
- **Efficient Computation**: Handles complex calculations and processing tasks.
- **Modular Design**: Organized in a way that makes the program easily extendable and maintainable.
- **Custom Input/Output**: Designed to handle different types of input and provide relevant output.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arnold-shakirov/tree-functions.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cpp-project
    ```

3. Compile the C++ file using `g++` or another C++ compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ -o main main.cpp
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

## Requirements
- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed on your system.
- **C++17** or higher recommended.
